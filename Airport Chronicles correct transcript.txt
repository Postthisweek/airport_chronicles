Airport Chronicles!
A plane glides serenely over a twinkling cityscape, crossing a glistening river under the moonlit sky, preparing for its descent with landing gears deployed.
Nearby, a lady carrying a backpack engages in animated conversation with a gentleman donning a vibrant green flowery shirt.
In a blur of motion, a yellow cab streaks across the tarmac, the lady now seated in the back, watching the bustling scene unfold.
Soon, they’re both eating together in the airport lounge.
Later, the man in the green flowery shirt is absorbed in a book at his desk, while the same lady chills on a couch in his living room, chatting with another woman.
Finally, they walk together through the airport, still with her backpack and now pulling her luggage, their steps echoing the good times they have shared.
